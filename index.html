				<h2 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h2>
				<p>Hello World! My name is Skylar Krieger, I am a UX Professional from the SF Bay Area. I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from SFSU in December 2020. Over the course of my career I designed and developed B2B, B2C, and Internal products at SAP, Ericsson, and PennyMac. I have touched all parts of the product lifecycle from proof of concept and initial prototyping to customer adoption to ensuring continuous integration and deployment and everything inbetween.</p>
